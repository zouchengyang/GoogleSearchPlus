# GoogleSearchPlus
help you search large amount of websites with specific targets

## Introduction
This is a Python program designed to perform automated searches on Google. By mimicking a userâ€™s behavior in a browser, the program uses predefined mandatory keywords and some optional keywords to browse webpages one by one and save the URLs that meet the requirements. Essentially, the program optimizes browser search results more precisely, ensuring that the saved URLs contain the specified keywords. This facilitates further detailed review and saves time and effort in gathering relevant information.

The program allows you to specify the starting page number and the number of pages to search. Both the mandatory and optional keywords can be customized (the sections requiring modification are clearly marked with noticeable blank lines before and after them in the program).

## Notice
To use the program, make sure to download the required Python packages and have the Chrome browser installed on your computer. When starting the program, if a CAPTCHA is triggered by the browser, you need to complete it within the allotted 20 seconds (if 20 seconds feels too short, you can adjust the wait time in the program). Once the CAPTCHA is completed, the program will automatically perform searches on Google and save the relevant results.
